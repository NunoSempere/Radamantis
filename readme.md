## Technical Requirements: high

Although it is written in JavaScript, Radamantis is not connected to the internet. Instead, it interacts with a node.js server which lives on the user's computer. Node can be installed from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and the server can be run like:

```
your@Computer:yourFilePath$ node miniserver.js
```
