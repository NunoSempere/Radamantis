# What is Radamantis?

Radamantis is a system of spartan design I use to add reflectivity into my life, about the things I care about, while protecting my privacy. You can see what it looks like below:

## How to install

Download Radamantis.zip, and unzip it in a convenient directory. Open Radamantis.html with a browser, and add it to your bookmarks. 

Although it is written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Radamantis is not connected to the internet. Instead, it interacts with a node.js server which lives on the user's computer. 

Node can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and the server can be run like:

```
your@Computer:yourFilePath$ node miniserver.js
```

Once node is installed and the server is running, Radamantis can be used normally. To change the motto that is displayed on the homepage, the user may edit the html.

## How to use
You can navigate by clicking on the red boxes. Documents are saved when they're no longer shown, but not if the browser or the window is abruptly closed.
